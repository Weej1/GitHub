Roadmap to v1.17
* Create MergeAndExtract script in case there's someone who has downloaded the 
  video but doesn't have 7zip installed and needs to extract the video in splits.

* Reduce encoding time - figure out what best settings are, get files from
  Investigations. 

* Switch to webm, not ideal as hevc BUT it removes the need for a player bundled
  separately. Chrome/Firefox can be used to play newly compressed video and no
  license restrictions. This will also reduce Toolkit filesize. 

* Set loglevels so that only one output is saved to log file and create script
  within *cnv-1min-test* that calculates average time to encode. 

* Setup Github so that versions of document file can be kept track of. 

* Add info.bat functionality to cnv-1min-test, this should save info of Windows 
  type in log.
